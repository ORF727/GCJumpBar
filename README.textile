@NSControl@ subclass that mimics the Xcode 4 Jump Bar.

h2. Usage

(See the demo project included)

When you have added the @GCJumpBar@ in your project, you simply allocate the Jump Bar and pass it a @NSMenu@. That's all. 

The Jump Bar can be used and the delegate and menu can be set in Interface Builder.

You can set a delegate that will receive messages when the Jump Bar change selection.

<pre>
- (void) jumpBar:(GCJumpBar*) jumpBar didSelectItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath*) indexPath;
</pre>

h2. Missing features

@GCJumpBar@ doesn't have all the feature present in Xcode 4. The subset of feature present right now was what I needed. However, I will continue to work on it and you're welcome to fork it!
